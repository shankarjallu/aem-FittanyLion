We want to assure Users of our enterprise websites, mobile applications, social media tools, member and patient portals, and other online or digital resources (collectively &amp;quot;Consumer Platforms&amp;quot;) that the information collected and/or provided to us is secure and maintained in confidence, consistent with applicable state and federal laws, regulations, and corporate standards. &amp;quot;Users&amp;quot; means any individual visiting, using, and/or providing Personal Information via one of our Consumer Platforms. References to &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; in this online privacy policy mean individual Users. &amp;quot;Personal Information&amp;quot; means any individually identifiable information about a User, including, but not limited to name, date of birth, address, phone number, e-mail address, account number, and IP (internet protocol) address. Please read through the following pages, which describe the type of information we collect, how we use information, and our commitment to maintaining the privacy and security of information.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Please be advised that Highmark Health does not own or control all Consumer Platforms used by our customers. This means that Highmark Health does not manage data collection, use, or disclosure activities which may occur on platforms owned by a Non-affiliated Third Party2; however, we may receive information from the platform owner about Users who visit our resources located on their platform. For example, Highmark Health maintains a Facebook page, but we have no control over how Facebook collects, uses, or discloses information obtained from Users when they visit the Highmark Health page.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>We cannot guarantee the security or confidentiality of Personal Information transmitted across Non-affiliated Third Party platforms that we do not own or control. For example, if a User initiates a message to Highmark Health through our Facebook page, Facebook may be able to view that content as the platform owner.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h2>I. INFORMATION COLLECTED&lt;/h2>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h5>A. GENERAL&lt;/h5>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>How you use a particular Highmark Health Consumer Platform will determine whether or not we collect Personal Information from you, and how much we collect. For many features, we do not require any Personal Information, nor will we ask questions about you. However, for others, we need to either verify your identity through a login process, or collect sufficient Personal Information to provide the service associated with that feature.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h5>B. SECURE MESSAGING AND FEEDBACK/INQUIRY FORMS&lt;/h5>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Highmark Health invites Users to contact us using secure messaging or feedback/inquiry forms available on our corporate-owned platforms regarding account questions or concerns, or Highmark Health&amp;#39;s products or services. We may disclose Personal Information to contracted Service Providers3&amp;nbsp;to allow them to perform a service or function for which they have been engaged. The information provided through secure messages and feedback/inquiry forms will be used by Highmark Health or its contracted Service Providers to review and respond to Users&amp;#39; communications.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Highmark Health has established online communications tools for members and patients to contact their health plan or physician regarding certain inquiries, such as account questions, referrals, prescription renewals, or medical issues. Messages sent by or to members or patients who choose to use these online services may be recorded in transaction logs, which may be reviewed to monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the overall effectiveness of the services.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Users can also inquire about products and services offered by a Non-affiliated Third Party or Service Provider by clicking hyperlinks which may be located on our Consumer Platforms. These hyperlinks will then redirect to the Non-affiliated Third Party or Service Provider website. Highmark Health makes no representations or warranties regarding these websites, their content, or security. Users should review the online privacy policy of the Non-affiliated Third Party or Service Provider for information regarding their data collection, use, and disclosure practices.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h5>C.

Cookies can capture information such as your IP address, your internet browser and operating system type, the date and time you visit a website, session information such as page response times, your search history, your saved preferences and password information (if you elect to have a website remember this information), information about the referring URL (uniform resource locator) and the URL clickstream to, through, and from our Consumer Platforms, and other similar details.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Highmark Health&amp;#39;s Consumer Platforms may use cookies to monitor the performance of our resources, to enhance the User experience, and to assess aggregate information about our User base. We may also employ cookies on Non-affiliated Third Party and Service Provider websites to facilitate the delivery of our services and help follow Users&amp;#39; online activities over time and across online resources to inform more relevant communication with Users. Highmark Health may gather and use information obtained from cookies to provide customers and prospects with tailored products and services.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Most internet browser settings can be modified by individuals to block or disable cookies (&amp;quot;do not track&amp;quot;). If a User decides to block or disable cookies in their internet browser settings, Highmark Health&amp;#39;s Consumer Platforms do not respond to these settings, and our use of cookies may not be affected. Users should be aware that blocking or disabling cookies could prevent a particular Consumer Platform or certain features from fully functioning, so Users are encouraged to keep cookies enabled.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h5>D. NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTY AND SERVICE PROVIDER USE OF COOKIES&lt;/h5>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>A Non-affiliated Third Party or Service Provider may employ cookies on our Consumer Platforms to facilitate the delivery of their services and help follow Users&amp;#39; online activities over time and across online resources.

All Personal Information will be disclosed in order to respond to a User&amp;#39;s needs, and/or to provide information about products or services offered by or through Highmark Health, its diversified businesses, or contracted Service Providers.
